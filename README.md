🦉 Math undergrad @ National Taiwan University | Collector of odd algorithms and sonic experiments  
🧭 AI Safety Taiwan explorer—wrangling reading groups, alignment puzzles, and the occasional meme  
🌐 Sculpting ambisonic soundworlds and HCI curios  
📊 Moonlighting as a quant—algorithmic trading is my sandbox  

---

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:**
  Dreaming up chimeric ambisonic soundscapes, building real-time HCI curios, and tinkering with new quant trading ideas.

* 🌱 **I’m currently learning:**
  The strange arts of AI interpretability, advanced probability, and the hidden geometry of spatial computing.

* 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:**
  Any project at the intersection of math, adaptive tech, and AI safety—or anything odd and ambitious.

* 💬 **Ask me about:**
  AI safety reading groups, curious math puzzles, sonic oddities, or why spatial audio is criminally underrated.

  **YouTube:** I share course clips focused on linear algebra and algebra.
  
  **Threads:** I post about finance insights, academic papers, and tech innovation.

* ⚡ **Fun fact:**
  Once mapped my kitchen in 3D sound just to make dishwashing feel like a sci-fi adventure.
